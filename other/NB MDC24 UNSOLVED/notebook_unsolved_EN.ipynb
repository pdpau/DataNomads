    "In this challenge you'll work with a big real dataset and you may have or haven't worked with datasets and code before. We're giving you a random dataset similarly structured as  an extract from the one you'll be given in the following days by Telef√≥nica. Please note that the data in this dataset is not real and any possible similarities with the reality are just coincidences. We propose you to solve this simple notebook working with this data. You may obtain results with no sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is composed of an CSV file with 6 columns:\n",
    "1. Day of the roaming entry (DD/MM/AAAA)\n",
    "2. Name of the province of origin\n",
    "3. Name of the province of destination\n",
    "4. Day of the week\n",
    "5. Count of cellular connections roamed from origin to destination (number of trips)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook to work, the dataset must be located in the same path as this notebook and the original name \"testdata.csv\". If you changed the name, make sure to change it in the file_path line below."
